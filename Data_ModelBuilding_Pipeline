# Data Model Building Pipeline


<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview
Duration: 5

### Steps by steps process for model building 


<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Step 1
Duration: 5

### Download/extract SEVIR_VIL_NOWCAST_TRANING.H5 and SEVIR_VIL_NOWCAST_TESTING.H5 from Google Storage Bucket

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Step 2
Duration:5

### Once acquired the training data, the ML team will build some kind of a model. The model will take imgx13, and it will generate imgx12. They'll train the model using that particular dataset as a training dataset.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Step 3
Duration: 5

### Once model is built, if I test it, how will my model perform. Compare (y,y^) to see some kind of specification of error to see if model is good enough for deployment. If not, tune it.

## Final Step
Duration: 5

### Once decision has been made, we will now have model parameters, so we'll basically have a trained model

### This process requires GPUs, huge infrastructure because you'll be training large amount of data with high level of complexity that will require a long amount of time


### Once everything works, export it into these 4 models files: MSE, Style, MSE-Style, GAN
